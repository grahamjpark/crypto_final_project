Things with 'COINFLIP-PROCESS' as the first line
	Victor (Server):
		Generate random number
		Hash random number
		SEND LINE 2: 'HASH'
			Send the hash
		RECIEVE LINE 2: 'BIT-GUESS'
		SEND LINE 2: 'RANDOM-NUMBER'
			The random number
		Compare to see if the guess was right, if guess is right it challenge is 1
	
	Peggy (Client):
		RECIEVE LINE 2: 'HASH'
			Store the hash for later
		generate random 1 or 0
		SEND LINE 2: 'BIT-GUESS'
			send the random
		RECIEVE LINE 2: 'RANDOM-NUMBER'
			Hashes the number and makes sure it's the same as what was earlier recieved
		Figure out whether it's odd
		Compare to see if the guess was right, if guess is right it challenge is 1
